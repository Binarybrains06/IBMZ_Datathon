### DELHI AIR POLLUTION DETECTOR

The survival of mankind cannot be imagined without air. Consistent developments in almost all realms of modern human society affected the health of the air adversely. Daily industrial, transport, and domestic activities are stirring hazardous pollutants in our environment. 

Monitoring and predicting air quality have become essentially important in this era, especially in developing countries like India. In contrast to the traditional methods, the prediction technologies based on machine learning techniques are proved to be the most efficient tools to study such modern hazards.

The present work investigates five years of air pollution data from DELHI for air quality analysis and prediction. The dataset is well preprocessed and key features are selected through the correlation analysis. An exploratory data analysis is exercised to develop insights into various hidden patterns in the dataset and pollutants directly affecting the air quality index are identified.
